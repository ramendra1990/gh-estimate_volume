2. Upload your DEM file (UTM projected) along with the polygons (projected with the same CRS) in the local repo using the upload button at the top
3. Run each box of codes and check the results for yourself
4. the estimated volumes will be stored in a csv file in the local binder repo. You can see the results directly thereby opening it, and you can also download the csv file to your local system folders
